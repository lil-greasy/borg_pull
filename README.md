# borg_pull
A script for using Borg in pull mode

Configuration is all at the top of the script.

This can back up multiple locations from a remote machine to Borg repositories on
a local machine. You just need SSH access to the remote machine.

You need to initialize the repositories on your local machine manually, but once
youâ€™ve done that, you should be able to schedule the script and forget it.
